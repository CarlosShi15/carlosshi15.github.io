# High-Order Physical-Constraint-Preserving CDG Methods for Special Relativistic Hydrodynamics

**Location:** Shenzhen, China  
**Role:** Group member, instructed by Associate Prof. Kailiang Wu  
**Duration:** September 2024 – January 2025  

## Research Contributions  

- Investigated and analyzed the properties of the admissible state set for the RHD equations, and verified the convexity and positivity 
of its equivalent explicit form under physical-constraint-preserving conditions using inequality proofs and randomized experiments.
- Conducted numerical experiments in MATLAB and performed symbolic derivations to prove the uniqueness of the positive root 
for the nonlinear pressure equation, and established the bijectivity between conservative and primitive variables.
- Validated monotonicity and positivity of the flux function with respect to density to ensure numerical fluxes remain within the 
physically admissible range during time evolution, contributing to developing a high-order PCP Central Discontinuous Galerkin 
numerical method compatible with general equations of state for realistic astrophysical problems.
