# High-Order Physical-Constraint-Preserving CDG Methods for Special Relativistic Hydrodynamics

**Location:** Shenzhen, China  
**Role:** Group member, instructed by Associate Prof. Kailiang Wu  
**Duration:** September 2024 – January 2025  

## Research Contributions  

- Analyzed the admissible state set of the RHD equations, rigorously verifying the convexity and positivity of its equivalent explicit 
form to provide theoretical guarantees for physical constraint preservation.
- Established the bijective correspondence between conservative and primitive variables by proving the uniqueness of the positive 
root for the nonlinear pressure equation via symbolic derivation.
- Validated the monotonicity and positivity of the flux function with respect to density, ensuring that numerical fluxes remain within 
the physically admissible range during time evolution.
