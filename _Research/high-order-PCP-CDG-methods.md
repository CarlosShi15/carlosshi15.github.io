# High-Order Physical-Constraint-Preserving CDG Methods for Special Relativistic Hydrodynamics

**Location:** Shenzhen, China  
**Role:** Group member, instructed by Associate Prof. Kailiang Wu  
**Duration:** September 2024 – January 2025  

## Research Contributions  

- Investigated and analyzed the properties of the admissible state set for the RHD equations, and verified their compliance with physical constraint preservation conditions through inequality proofs and randomized experiments.  
- Participated in developing a high-order PCP Central Discontinuous Galerkin numerical method compatible with general equations of state, overcoming the limitations of ideal gas assumptions and enhancing applicability to realistic astrophysical problems.  
- Conducted numerical experiments in MATLAB and performed symbolic derivations to prove the bijectivity and monotonicity between core variables, validating the approach's accuracy, robustness, and precision.
