# Neural-Network-Based Least-Squares PDE Solver with Analytically Reparameterized Basis Functions

**Location:** Shenzhen, China  
**Role:** Group member, supervised by Prof. Jiang Yang  
**Duration:** June 2025 – Present  

## Key Contributions


- Reproduced Transnet, Multi-Transnet, and MAE-Transnet models to solve:
  - Elliptic and wave equations
  - Elliptic interface problems  
  - Singular perturbation problems in multiple dimensions
  - Summarized a modified Transnet version to improve efficiency and accuracy in linear PDEs.
- Analyzed the limitations of Transnet on high-dimensional and nonlinear PDEs, including:
  - Poisson equation
  - Burger's equation  
  - Steady-state Navier-Stokes equation
- Proposed a hybrid-Transnet model integrating MLP and Transnet, evaluated its performance through numerical experiments, and designed an iterative Transnet approach for nonlinear PDEs.
- Utilized multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to study the staircase phenomenon and $\epsilon$-rank, and analyzed neuron linear independence and initialization effects during experiment training. 
- Currently exploring the Structured First-Layer Initialization Pre-Training Techniques to Accelerate Training Process Based on $\epsilon$-Rank.(on-going)
