### About me

I’m Yanhao Shi (史衍昊), a senior undergraduate student from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), advised by Prof. Jiang Yang. Previously, I was a visiting student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Summer 2025.

### Research Interest:

- scientific computing
- machine learning
- Numerical solutions of PDEs


### Career Goals

My long-term goal is to pursue a career as a research scientist in either academia or industry, dedicated to promoting the development of combinations of machine learning and numerical methods. I aim to explore convergence acceleration strategies for deep neural network-based numerical algorithms and promote the algorithms' ability to extract data information. Ultimately, I hope to advance the scientific computing field by designing an Adaptive Neuron Matcher to automatically accelerate algorithm convergence.

I am actively seeking PhD opportunities starting in Fall 2026!
