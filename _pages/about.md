### About me

I am a senior students in Southern University of Science and Technology

### Research Interest:

- scientific computing
- machine learning
- Numerical solutions of PDEs


### Career Goals

My long-term goal is to pursue a career as a research scientist in either academia or industry, dedicated to promoting the development of combinations of machine learning and numerical methods. I aim to explore convergence acceleration strategies for deep neural network-based numerical algorithms and promote the algorithms' ability to extract data information. Ultimately, I hope to advance the scientific computing field by designing an Adaptive Neuron Matcher to automatically accelerate algorithm convergence.
