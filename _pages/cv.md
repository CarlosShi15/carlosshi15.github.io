# Project Experience

## Nonparametric Approach to Modeling Gene Expression for Riboflavin Production in Bacillus subtilis
*Team Member · Instructed by Assoc. Prof. Xin Chen | April 2025 – May 2025*

- Analyzed riboflavin production distribution and visualized 4088 gene expression patterns via histograms and correlation networks; applied Gaussian kernel KDE for smooth estimation of response variables (optimal MSE: 0.0047).
- Identified 41 key genes related to riboflavin biosynthesis using PCA with five-fold cross-validation; built SIM and PLM, applying kernel regression for nonlinear variables (LASSO) and linear models for others.
- Compared statistical and machine learning models (random forest, neural networks) for performance and interpretability; performed SVM classification and LOESS/SIR analysis to explain enzyme-limited production.

## Numerical Solutions to Nonlinear Allen–Cahn and Elliptic Equations
*Team Member · Supervised by Prof. Jiang Yang*

- Applied MATLAB to solve partial differential equations numerically, enhancing analytical and coding skills through two independent projects.
- Solved elliptic equations using SOR iteration and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on a fixed grid, visualizing error distribution and second-order convergence.
- Solved the nonlinear Allen–Cahn equation via FFT, incorporating a viscosity term into the difference scheme to ensure numerical stability.

## Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Inversion of Global Thermal Conductivity in 2D Space Materials
*Team Member · Mentored by Prof. Jingzhi Li*

- Conducted literature review on inverse heat conduction problems, transforming them into optimization problems via mathematical modeling.
- Simulated material thermal conduction in air to model temperature distribution over position and time; performed perturbation analysis on the heat conduction equation.
- Generated 2D thermal distribution data in Python based on assumed parameters and applied particle swarm optimization to invert thermal conductivity coefficients that best fit temperature distributions.

## Ranking Popularity: Applying PageRank to SUSTech Cafeterias
*Team Member · Instructed by Prof. Jingzhi Li*

- Collected lunch and dinner choices from 50 students via questionnaire and constructed a discrete Markov chain to model dietary selection.
- Visualized survey data in MATLAB using a doubly stochastic matrix, demonstrating PageRank logic and weight distribution between "pages".
- Applied PageRank algorithm in Java to iteratively compute cafeteria scores, quantify popularity rankings, and analyze underlying influencing factors.
